# First meeting in the multipurpose school.
On February 5 we went to talk with the directors of the 11th cam to be able to inform us and know a little   
more about the subject, thanks to this we were able to inform ourselves what was necessary to be able to work   
with them. This day we talked about our project objective and asked some questions to be able to reaffirm   
certain information with which we had doubts since on the internet there is certain information which is not   
totally assured or very old.
