Today we did a summary of the first delivery, it helped me to get a better idea on how we are doing refering to the timings
and how much effort we need to put in to do a good job at delivery times and quality of our project. It was more of a 
restrospectic view at our past activities and how we can improve the focus and attention that we really pay to this.
