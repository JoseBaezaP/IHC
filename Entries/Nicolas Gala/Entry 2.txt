Yesterday we had a meeting through Hang Out with the teacher to solve certain questions that we had confusion with,
we sorted that out concluding that we need to focus more on the argumentation on why we are using some tools and why
we find some information important for our project. Aswell that we need to really have an idea on how make our tool
work with what the students want and how to make them use it more than once and get them interested.
