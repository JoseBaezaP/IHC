# Change of project idea 
### First week of April


Due to the start of the COVID19 pandemic and the cancellation of the face-to-face classes, we could not continue with the planning of our project that is mainly focused on the children of CAM 12, however, we could no longer continue to be in contact with the school. So we decided to meet to change the focus of the project adapting to the situation in which we find ourselves, the focus is more focused on the teachers to provide a tool that helps them measure the performance of their students, in addition to the situation in the that we are it was easier to have contact with adults. So, we started to develop the new approach of our project.
