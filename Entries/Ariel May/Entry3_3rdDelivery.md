# Starting the Software Requiriments Specification (ERS)
### Friday April 15

On Friday, April 15, with all the information we had about the new idea of the project, we began to prepare the documents for the second installment, so the whole team met to divide the sections of the software requirements specification. The requirements we had written were not requirements as such, so we had to change for the second installment.
The way in which we divide the ERS sections are as follows

|Partes del ERS|Autor|status
|---|--|--|
|Introducción| Leonardo|Terminado
|Descripcion General|Baeza|Terminado
|Requisitos Específicos|Ariel|Revision
|Casos de Uso|Nicolas|Revision

During that week I wrote the functional system requirements, however the non-functional usability requirements are more difficult to write as I couldn't think of many things they could write so I looked for Software Architecture material to complement the ideas that had and could write non-functional requirements.

Likewise, we began to have problems since the teacher we were working with had little interest in continuing to work, so we began to look for another alternative in case she can no longer help us.
