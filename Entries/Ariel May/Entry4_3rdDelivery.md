# Starting the document for the second delivery
### Friday April 30


During this week we were working on the second delivery of the project, so we met in Discord to know how far we had progressed, we only had the ERS and prototype started, with the update rubric, we started to check the what we needed to do. I started to make the traceability matrix document, because I had written the requirements software, also I started to investigate about the inspection methods as I couldn’t attend the class Thursday April 30, 2020,so I don’t know what that mean, I found several techniques, one of them was heuristics evaluation, which the teacher had previously told us about.

In addition, I started to document the part of the development prototype that on the templates we used and the color psychology
