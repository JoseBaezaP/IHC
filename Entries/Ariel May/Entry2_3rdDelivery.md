# 10 Usability Heuristics for User Interface Design
### Thursday, April 2

In this Thursday session, the teacher talks about user interfaces and explains the 10 usability heuristics for user interface design by Jakob Nielsen, which is recommended that the interfaces that we design for our project comply of these heuristics 

* visibility of system status
* match between system and the real world
* user control and freedom 
* Consistency and standards
* Error prevention

these are some of the Jakobâ€™s heuristics.
the teacher asked us to make the first prototype of the project and recommended us to use InVision which is a tool for the prototype, also Invision allows teamwork, however, we had problems since we did not know how to implement the cooperative work, so in the end, we ended up working individually with the application.
