# Interaction Design
### Sunday, May 3

While we were doing the activities for the second installment, there was a section for interaction design, which I didn't know what it was and what it meant, so I did some research about it and learned about the process. Which is before interface design.

"Interaction design can be understood in simple (but not simplified) terms: it is the design of the interaction between users and products. Most often when people talk about interaction design, the products tend to be software products like apps or websites. The goal of interaction design is to create products that enable the user to achieve their objective(s) in the best way possible." Yu Siang Teo(2020)

The 5 dimensions of interaction design
* Words
* Visual representations
* Physical objects or space
* Time
* Behaviour
  
In this process it is designed how you want the user to use your application, also allow for if it is an application, it will be Web, it will be on the desktop, it will be mobile, all these characteristics must allow for,  when developing, because each one has different interactions with the user, which makes it possible to make a user-friendly application.
We used these characteristics to develop our prototype, since it informed me that I should further investigate mobile design.
