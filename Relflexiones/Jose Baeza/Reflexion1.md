#Reflection of the research   
In the first weeks to start this course we had to read about a research article, I chose one that talked about the   
analysis of eye fixations during a visual comparison task to measure the novelty preference, this experiment was   
based on a tracker, which tracked their appearance in some images that appeared on the screen, in this way they   
were measuring according to the choices made by the user to be able to draw conclusions about it, but their   
conclusions or results, in the end did not turn out so well, since the camera they used to track their eyes, they   
regularly descalibbated themselves and did not notice it until a somewhat elevated moment of the test, that is why   
they could not have a very accurate analysis of what they wanted to evaluate, even so they could draw their   
conclusion which was based on many things that they chose was with respect to the previous one and these elections   
had a why, if it was because it was more novel, more attractive as or vision or simply because it reminded him of   
the previous one.
